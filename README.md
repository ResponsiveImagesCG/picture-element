# Welcome! 
This is the home of the bleeding edege version of [the ```picture``` element spec](http://responsiveimagescg.github.com/picture-element/).

It's where we do our crazy experiments before the spec over to the W3C. 

## found a bug? Want to discuss something? 
If you found a problem with the spec, no matter how small, please [file a bug](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/picture-element/issues).  

Proposals for normative changes to the specification should take place on the <a href="public-respimg@w3.org"><abbr title="Responsive Images Community Group">RICG mailing list</a>.

## Let me see it! 
It's on [github pages](http://picture.responsiveimages.org).
